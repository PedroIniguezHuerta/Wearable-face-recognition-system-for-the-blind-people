Wearable face recognition system for the blind people

By Pedro Iniguez Huerta


In this repository I present a low cost solution for the blind people. The original idea was that multiples companies and universities sponsor 
the development and production of this solution and provide to poor people this solution for free. 
Because this is a low cost solution much more people could take advantage of it.
This solution needs additional work prior releasing to the market.
Additional capabilities can also be added to this solution because Hardware still can support additional features.
The solutions supports GPIO keyboard, USB keyboard, multi language support, multi face detection algorithms, multi face recognition algorithms.
This solution supports detection of multiple people and calculates the distance of each people detected.
This solution was tested to work on distances up to 4 meters however could be improved to support bigger distances.

Some important notes:
1. This application can be loaded at boot time and executed automatically without the need of a monitor.
2. This solution comes with no dataset, however use the registration option to generate new datasets.
3. This solution comes with no audio files, however use recorder.py to generate new audio files.
4. This solution uses external files:
   - camerafix.sh ==> enable camera on Raspberry PI
   - recorder.py ==> Allows to generated
   - database.db ==> sqlite3 db
   - Files required for face detection and training purposes.
      * deploy.prototxt
      * haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml  (HaarCascade Face Detection)
      * lbpcascade_frontalface.xml  (HaarCascade Face Recognition)
      * opencv_face_detector.pbtxt
      * res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel (DNN Face Detection)
    - Working subdirectories:
      * commands ==> audio files in multilanguage format.
      * distances ==> audio files in multilanguage format.
      * people ==> audio files in multilanguage format.
      * dataset ==> contains the list of faces conforming the dataset
      * dataset_temp_dir ==> Temporal directory used to store images during registration process.
      * facesDetected ==> Directory containing the extracted faces and prior prepared to be moved to dataset subdirectory
      * names ==> Contains the names to be displayed after face recognition process. 
                  These are autogenerated and generic however can be manually renamed to have a better experience on recognized names.
                  The Blind listen audio names so these names are not important for them however makes easier development.
      * recognizer ==> Contains the trained models in Yaml format.
5. This solution was developed as my tesis for getting a master degree. Presentation can be found in the following link:
